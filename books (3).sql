While the overall picture of Asian growth is positive, no single economic policy has been effective regionwide. Interventionist policies that worked well in some countries failed elsewhere.

The end of the Cold War has unleashed new economic and political forces, and new regionalisms have emerged. Computing power is increasingly an impetus to the world economy, and technological developments have changed and are changing almost every aspect of contemporary economic affairs.

The pressures on organizations to change will only increase over the next decades.

In \"Herding Cats\", Geoff Garrett and Graeme Davies combine their top-level experience of leading/managing international academic and research institutions with wisdom gleaned from 50 senior colleagues around the world. They deal with common leadership and management themes, like making tough strategic choices, leading change effectively, dealing with bureaucracy, allocating resources, managing budgets and ensuring effective implementation. Garrett, Davies and their friends paint a picture of the culture of a typical \'cats\' environment - replete with remarkable intellects, passion, arguments, politics and prejudice, and where trying to push people to a destination is usually doomed to failure. \"Herding Cats\" guides leaders and aspiring leaders in academic and research institutions through the process of learning to accept and embrace the qualities of their \'cats\' so they can tempt them to an outcome with agility and success.', 'https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780956537959-uk-300.jpg'),

It sought to bring about a revolution, commonly referred to as the \"Keynesian Revolution\", in the way economists thought ? especially challenging the proposition that a market economy tends naturally to restore itself to full employment on its own. Regarded widely as the cornerstone of Keynesian thought, this book challenged the established classical economics and introduced new concepts. It remains a relevant topic of debate to this day, perhaps more than ever. Given the economic turmoil of recent years, this debate is more heated than ever before, between the Keynesian model of economics of Bush and Obama which favors bailouts and other government intervention to try to stabilize the market, and the Austrian school of economics which sees government intervention as detrimental and favors letting the market sort itself out on its own with minimal government interference and regulation.
